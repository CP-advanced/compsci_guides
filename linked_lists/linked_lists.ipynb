    "# Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "The first important division between data structures is those that are contiguous vs. linked. Contiguous is easy to think about as something that would be a slab of memory, where you know how to access any item in the chunk of memory without inspecting the actual data. The most typical contiguous data structure is an Array. In contrast, linked data structures require accessing the actual elements stored in order to find the other elements in the data structure. In that the elements themselves have pointers to other elements in the data structure. The best example of a linked structure is the Linked List. A linked list might be a good choice for situations like: implementing a priority queue, implementing undo/redo list, browser back button, handling dictionary collisions, or the system's heap allocation.\n",

    "So the node in a linked list contains both the data at that location as well as a reference to another location in the data structure. This is a node in a Singly Linked List, where each item only tells you about the next item in the data structure. You may see any number of pointers to other parts of the data structure, but in 99% of interview problems you will be dealing with a Singly Linked List, from now we'll just call Linked List. Here is an example drawing of a linked list with two items, where the data stored in each item is a number.\n",

    "- Memory overflow, i.e., running out of memory you reserved for your data structure, never occurs unless you run out of all memory because you simply create a new node and point to it.\n",

    "- You use extra memory per item to store the references to other items\n",
    "- Slow random access\n",
