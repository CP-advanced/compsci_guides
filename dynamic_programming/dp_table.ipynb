    "# Dynamic Programming Table\n",
    "This is one of the most helpful visualization techniques for designing bottom-up DP algorithms. It is basically a way of drawing the DAG of computation when the computational structure of your problem is best explained in two dimensions. Let's motivate this with a popular example problem. \n",

    "## Longest Palindromic Substring\n",
    "Let's take a look at the problem of [Finding the Longest Palindromic Substring](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/).\n",
    "\n",
    ">Given a string s, find the longest palindromic substring in s. You may assume that the maximum length of s is 1000.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"babad\"\n",
    "Output: \"bab\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note: \"aba\" is also a valid answer.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Brute Force Solution\n",
    "The most obvious way to solve this is to simply look at all substrings of the string, see if it is a palindrome and if it is save it if its length is greater than the previously save substring. It is not hard to see that this is a pretty bad algorithm with time complexity $O(N!)$."
